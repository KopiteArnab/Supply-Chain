# Supply-Chain
- Create a "Supplier Overview" dashboard, which gives us a supplier status and its capabilities. This will help the resposible Buyer get a focused quick insight for the suppliers.
- Create a "Volume Movement" dashboard, to help analyze the Purchase volume and Tonnage volume movement throught different years for past comparisons and business planning.
- Improving the way our visuals interact with each other, and give more exposure to insightful data.

## Introduction
The Accounts Department of the Company maintains the invoice level details of all vendors for each part procured. The Business Planner receives invoice data from the Accounts Department for each vendor and collects the supplier and part level information separately from the Purchase Department. The Business Planner has to study the relevant data and identify the Procurement trends, Supplier limitations, Product based supplier consolidation and minimise cost impact to company.

## Problem Description
As the collected Data is of different years for multiple Plants grouped by different Business Units. The parts are either made of Aluminium or Ferrous of different raw material grade alloys, with the source being either Tier 1 supplier or Tier 2 supplier. Considering all these factors, create a dashboard which is insightful on all these factors and can help the Procurement Department make better supply chain strategic decisions.
